## Part 2 – CSS Styling and Responsive Design

This project continues from **Part 1** and focuses on implementing **CSS styling** and **responsive design**.

## Updates Made
- Applied **typography styles**: font-size, line-height, font-weight, and letter-spacing across headings, body, and form elements.
- Created **layout structures** using **Flexbox** (navigation, hero, footer) and **CSS Grid** (cards, form layout).
- Implemented **visual styles** including hover, focus, and active states for buttons, navigation, and calendar days.
- Added **responsive design breakpoints**:
  - Tablet view at 768px (2-column grids, stacked navbar).
  - Mobile view at 400px (single-column layout, dropdown menu).
- Integrated **relative units** (`rem`, `%`) for scalable typography and spacing.
- Ensured **responsive images** with flexible sizing and `object-fit`.
- Cleaned up **color variables** and used CSS custom properties for maintainability.

## Testing
- Tested using **Chrome Developer Tools** on desktop, tablet, and mobile simulated screens.
- Verified typography, layout, and responsive breakpoints function as required.
- Confirmed hover, focus, and active states work across interactive elements.
